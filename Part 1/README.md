# Model Loss and MAE
    - Model Loss plot (left) shows high initial volatility in validation loss that stabilizes after about 5 epochs, while training loss decreases more smoothly
    - Model MAE (Mean Absolute Error) plot shows similar patterns to the loss plot, with both metrics improving and stabilizing over time
    - shows typical early training instability but good convergence
