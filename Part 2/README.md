# Model Loss and Accuracy.png
    - Model Loss plot (left) shows both training and validation loss decreasing over 80 epochs, with validation loss ending up slightly lower than training loss. This suggests good convergence without obvious overfitting. 
    - Model Accuracy plot (right) shows validation accuracy consistently higher than training accuracy, reaching around 55% while training accuracy reaches about 35%. The trend suggests the model is learning, though the gap between training and validation accuracy is unusual.

# Prediction vs true.png
    - A scatter plot of Predicted Sum vs True Sum, with a red diagonal line representing perfect predictions
    - The blue dots cluster closely around the red line, indicating good correlation between predictions and actual values
    - The model appears to be performing well across the range of values (0-35), with consistent accuracy across the spectrum
